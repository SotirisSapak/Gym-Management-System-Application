# GYM Management System Application

Just a senior thesis. This is an android application that simplifies the receipt system of a gym. Chance of experiment with Firebase Firestore technology from Google because one of the requirements for this app is to store its data online.

### Abstract
In many Gyms, the payment receipts are in paper format. So , it is very
difficult for both gym members to keep all the paper receipts safely and to
gym trainer to keep reminding for the fee receipts. Sometimes it creates a
trouble when members lost their receipts. The other problem that can be
faced by a gym owner is that if he/she wants to inform any message related
to working or non-working days of gym, manually sending message become
difficult. If there is online application available these probl ems can be
solved. So, I am developing an android application to overcome some of
these issues. So, this project can be helpful for both gym owner as well as
for gym members. In this application all receipts are store in a digital
format, so there are no i ssues of losing any confidential receipts. This
application will als o notify the user (gym members) about their fees and
notifies the gym ow ner about the payment clearance. This application in
future can be elaborated by providing supplement store, diet in formation,
personal training etc.
